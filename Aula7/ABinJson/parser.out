Grammar

Rule 0     S' -> Final
Rule 1     Final -> ABin
Rule 2     ABin -> PA PF
Rule 3     ABin -> PA NUM ABin ABin PF

Terminals, with rules where they appear

NUM                  : 3
PA                   : 2 3
PF                   : 2 3
error                : 

Nonterminals, with rules where they appear

ABin                 : 1 3 3
Final                : 0

Parsing method: LALR

state 0

    (0) S' -> . Final
    (1) Final -> . ABin
    (2) ABin -> . PA PF
    (3) ABin -> . PA NUM ABin ABin PF

    PA              shift and go to state 3

    Final                          shift and go to state 1
    ABin                           shift and go to state 2

state 1

    (0) S' -> Final .



state 2

    (1) Final -> ABin .

    $end            reduce using rule 1 (Final -> ABin .)


state 3

    (2) ABin -> PA . PF
    (3) ABin -> PA . NUM ABin ABin PF

    PF              shift and go to state 4
    NUM             shift and go to state 5


state 4

    (2) ABin -> PA PF .

    $end            reduce using rule 2 (ABin -> PA PF .)
    PA              reduce using rule 2 (ABin -> PA PF .)

state 5

    (3) ABin -> PA NUM . ABin ABin PF
    (2) ABin -> . PA PF
    (3) ABin -> . PA NUM ABin ABin PF

    PA              shift and go to state 3

    ABin                           shift and go to state 6

state 6

    (3) ABin -> PA NUM ABin . ABin PF
    (2) ABin -> . PA PF
    (3) ABin -> . PA NUM ABin ABin PF

    PA              shift and go to state 3

    ABin                           shift and go to state 7

state 7

    (3) ABin -> PA NUM ABin ABin . PF

    PF              shift and go to state 8


state 8

    (3) ABin -> PA NUM ABin ABin PF .

    $end            reduce using rule 3 (ABin -> PA NUM ABin ABin PF .)
    PA              reduce using rule 3 (ABin -> PA NUM ABin ABin PF .)
